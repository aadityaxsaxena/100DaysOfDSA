/*Problem: Deque (Double-Ended Queue)
A Deque is a linear data structure that allows insertion and deletion of elements from both the front and the rear. It provides more flexibility than a standard queue or stack.
Common Operations:
1. push_front(value): Insert an element at the front of the deque.
2. push_back(value): Insert an element at the rear of the deque.
3. pop_front(): Remove an element from the front of the deque.
4. pop_back(): Remove an element from the rear of the deque.
5. front(): Return the front element of the deque.
6. back(): Return the rear element of the deque.
7. empty(): Check whether the deque is empty.
8. size(): Return the number of elements in the deque.
Additional Operations:
- clear(): Remove all elements from the deque.
- erase(): Remove one or more elements from the deque.
- swap(): Swap contents of two deques.
- emplace_front(): Insert an element at the front without copying.
- emplace_back(): Insert an element at the rear without copying.
- resize(): Change the size of the deque.
- assign(): Replace elements with new values.
- reverse(): Reverse the order of elements.
- sort(): Sort the elements in ascending order.
Time Complexity:
- push_front, push_back, pop_front, pop_back, front, back, empty, size: O(1)
- clear, erase, resize, assign, reverse: O(n)
- sort: O(n log n)
Input:
- Sequence of deque operations with values (if applicable)
Output:
- Results of operations such as front, back, size, or the final state of the deque after all operations*/
